- Will want a move history in the engine

Q: How will my notation match up with the standard algebraeic chess notation?


# engine

how to force the concept of board and piece state?
  => the contrast btwn white and black pawn movement direction might do it

  => => it is actually going to come when we need to consider things like capture, move blocking, pawn captures, etc

Q: where should move validation logic actually live? on piece classes? in the top-level game manager? Is it a mix?

## pawn class

todo: en passant, promotion (??)
